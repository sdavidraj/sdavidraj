# Hello, my name is Selwyn

I am a Enterprise Architect at Tata Consultancy Services, where I'm helping customers adopt a cloud first approach and move applications and workloads to cloud.

My mission is to help every developer to build with AI responsibly, ethically, and successfully, leveraging everything from open models to foundation models like Gemini and Gemma, across cloud and on-device platforms.

I am leading strategic collaborations and partnerships with major cloud providers [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), Akamai etc).

Working with multiple customers, I was instrumental in growing our revenue from $0 to ~$40 million in 4 years through our cloud and SRE offerings. I served as the SR Technical/Engineering Manager for key partnerships, creating solutions like . My focus has consistently been on making advanced AI, particularly LLMs and RLHF, accessible and practical for real-world applications.

Beyond development, I collaborated with Hugging Face's open-source and science teams to improve LLM accessibility and focused on leveraging RLHF for enterprise and business use cases, including Zephyr, SmollLM, StarCoder and more.

My passion for cloud computing began over 8 years ago and I have been involved in AI  I've designed and implemented multiple cloud-native AI architectures for various industries and was recognized as the first German AWS Machine Learning Hero in 2021. I actively share my knowledge through research, blog posts, and on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) and [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/).

On my blog [digitalselwyn.com](https://www.digitalselwyn.com), I break down complex AI concepts, share practical tutorials, and provide insights into the latest advancements in the field, a practice I continue to this day.
